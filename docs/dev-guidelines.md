# Guidelines

## Simplicit of libs and microservices
Keep all code simple and maintainable with documentation when needed following language standards.

## Use Docker
All microservice should have its Dockerfile in order to join the deployment in docker-compose.yml file. Please add comments to "trick" parts when needed. 

## Tests
Please write tests if possible, at least for the trick situations hard to test.
