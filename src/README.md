# General inscructions about source code

## apps directory
The apps directory should handle the applications source code, like the frontend and reverse proxy. Every app folder, besides the source code, should have a Dockerfile for that application and a README file explaining the project.

## libs directory
The libs directory should handle important libs that are used on this project. Those libs should be placed inside of a directory with a README file explaining the API and its use.
